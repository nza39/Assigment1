Next, I used the free sentimmental analyzer as my second tool. When analyzing our dataset the analyzer Sentiment scores range from -100 to +100, where -100 indicates a very negative or serious tone and +100 indicates a very positive or enthusiastic tone. This online service sees computational linguistics and text mining to automatically to determine the sentiment or affective nature of the text being analyzed.
My dataset has a sentiment score of -8.6. This means that the overall sentiment or tone of this text is essentially neutral. the second tool is in accordance with our first analysis that our dataset of covid 19 policy ermerges as neutral.
