Four-Dried-Chilies Chili with Cocoa & Cinnamon 
"We're having chili night, people!" says Rach. Her hearty, full-flavored (but not too spicy!) version includes red and black beans and can be made with ground beef, pork or turkey, or even a plant-based meat substitute. She likes to prepare her own chili pepper mix, but you can definitely use a jarred chili powder blend. Cinnamon and cocoa add richness and depth. Top the finished chili with the garnishes of your choosing and enjoy over the holidays or on game day with family or friends. Ingredients

Stuffed Savoy Cabbage
"If you're a person who digs stuffed cabbage, it's that time of year!" says Rach. "This recipe is adapted from a book from the year I was born, 1968. The book was written in Italian, but I did my best to translate it!" The cabbage is kept whole and the leaves are stuffed with a combo of ground beef, pork and veal, parboiled rice and seasonings, then wrapped in cheesecloth and baked in a flavored broth. The result is pretty spectacular—and delicious! Try pairing it with John's Lambrusco Negroni.  
Ingredients
To Prepare the Cabbage for Stuffing:
Salt
1 medium Savoy cabbage
For the Stuffing:
2 tablespoons EVOO
2 tablespoons butter
1 onion, finely chopped
A handful of parsley, finely chopped
Salt and pepper
2 cloves garlic, chopped
1 ½ pounds ground beef, pork and veal, combined
8 leaves of sage, thinly slice or chopped
1 tablespoon rosemary, finely chopped
1/8 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg
1 cup short-grain white rice, rinsed and par-cooked 5 minutes in boiling water, then strained
1 large egg, lightly beaten
1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
To Stuff the Cabbage:
1 large piece of cheesecloth, large enough to wrap the whole cabbage
Kitchen twine
To Cook the Stuffed Cabbage:
2 tablespoons butter
2 small onions, sliced
3 carrots, thinly sliced on bias
2 ribs celery, thinly sliced on bias
4 cloves garlic, crushed or sliced
2 bay leaves
Salt and pepper
2 cups broth or bone stock (beef)
Yield
Serves: 4 to 6
Preparation
To prepare the cabbage for stuffing, fill a large pot with water (the pot needs to be big enough to accommodate the entire head of cabbage). Bring water to a boil and liberally salt it. Meanwhile, pull off the very large outer leaves of the cabbage and discard. Using a paring knife, remove as much of the core of the cabbage as possible (really dig it out while still maintaining the whole cabbage shape). Carefully place the cabbage in the boiling water and boil for 5 minutes. Dry and cool the cabbage on kitchen towels. (While you are waiting for the cabbage to cool, you can prepare the stuffing). Once the cabbage is cool, working with the core-side up, separate leaves as much as possible while maintaining the cabbage's shape. You are making spaces to hold the stuffing in between the leaves.    
For the stuffing, heat a Dutch oven over medium heat with EVOO, 2 turns of the pan, and melt butter into oil. Add onions, parsley, salt and pepper and stir 2 minutes. Add garlic and stir, then add the ground meats, more salt and pepper and the sage, rosemary and nutmeg. Remove from heat. Place meat in a bowl and cool. Add the par-cooked rice to the meat and combine with egg and Worcestershire.   
To stuff the cabbage, with the core side up, place some filling between the separated leaves, pushing it as far down as you can and in as many spaces as you were able to create. Do this until you have used all the stuffing. Lay the cheesecloth in a single layer on your work surface. Gather up the stuffed cabbage and transfer to the cheesecloth core-side down. Wrap the cheesecloth up and around the cabbage, then gather the 4 corners at the top of the cabbage and twist to create a tight cabbage package. Tie the twisted cheesecloth tightly with kitchen twine. Set aside and prepare the cabbage cooking base.  
Preheat oven to 350°F, with rack at center.  
To cook the stuffed cabbage, melt the butter in a large Dutch oven over medium heat, add onions, carrots, celery, garlic, bay, salt and pepper and sweat a few minutes, partially covered.
Classic Coq au Vin 
Rachael shares a classic coq au vin, the perfect recipe when it's cold out and you're having family or friends over for dinner or a long Sunday lunch. She also has a funny anecdote about the French word coq. "Literally, coq au vin means rooster or cock in wine," she says, "but it always makes me think of my friend Pierette, who runs a small cozy bistro, Chez Pierre, in upstate New York. Her restaurant and bar have beautiful murals and over the bar is a painting of a coq that says 'Quand ce coq chante les boissons sont gratutites,' which translates to 'when this cock sings, the drinks are free'!"
Ingredients
8 to 12 pieces of dark meat, bone-in, skin-on chicken (buy 4 to 6 large, full legs—thigh and drums attached—and use a boning knife to separate at joint)
16 to 18 pearl or pickling onions, peeled and trimmed
2 large fresh bay leaves
3 cups for 8 pieces of chicken or 1 bottle for 12 pieces red Burgundy wine
Salt and pepper
2 tablespoons EVOO
1/3 pound guanciale, thick-cut bacon or pancetta, cut into lardons, or batons of pork belly or cheek
3 tablespoons butter
1 ½ pounds white or cremini mushrooms, wiped clean and quartered
A small bundle of fresh thyme
¼ cup brandy, such as Cognac or Armagnac
2 tablespoons tomato paste
4 large garlic cloves, crushed
¼ cup flour
3 cups beef bone broth or stock or chicken bone stock
1 small container of demiglace (about 2 tablespoons)
To Serve:
Yield
Serves: 4 to 6
Preparation
Combine the chicken and onions in a large plastic food storage bag or shallow dish, add bay leaves and cover in wine, then marinate overnight. Strain and reserve wine. Pat the pieces of chicken dry and reserve the onions and bay. Place wine in a small pot, reduce by half and set aside off heat.  

Preheat oven to 350°F.  

Season chicken with salt and pepper and heat large cast-iron skillet or Dutch oven over medium-high heat with 2 tablespoons oil. 
Individual Beef Wellingtons 
Ingredients
For the Duxelles:
1½ pounds mushrooms, such as maitake and crimini or any mix you prefer
6 tablespoons butter
2 large shallots, finely chopped
4 cloves garlic, finely chopped
1 tablespoon fresh thyme, finely chopped
Salt and pepper
¼ cup dry sherry
For the Individual Beef Wellingtons:
4 center-cut filet mignon steaks, 2½ inches thick
Salt and black pepper
1 tablespoon neutral oil or non-aerosol neutral cooking spray
2 ounces brandy
4 teaspoons Dijon mustard
One 14-oz package of puff pastry (Rach likes Dufour), defrosted for 2 hours in fridge before using
A small handful or scoop of flour, to roll dough
One 8-ounce terrine or slab of peppercorn mousse pate or truffle mousse pate
1 egg and about 2 teaspoons water, for egg wash
Yield
Serves: 4
Preparation
Clean mushrooms with damp cloth, stem and chop about ¼ inch.  
For the duxelles, heat a large skillet over medium-high heat and melt butter to foam. Add mushrooms and brown until fragrant and volume reduces by about half, then add shallots, garlic, thyme, salt and pepper, and stir until shallots are softened, 3 minutes. Add sherry and let it absorb fully, then remove from heat and cool mixture in shallow bowl or on a tray.
Bring meat to room temp and pat dry. Gently press down each steak to spread surface area a bit, leaving steaks 2 to 2¼ inches thick, and season with salt and pepper. Heat a cast-iron skillet or griddle over high, add oil and brush or wipe it around the pan or spray with non-aerosol cooking spray). Add meat to pan, reduce heat to medium-high and cook to develop a crust on the meat, but not to cook through; it should remain very rare, 1½ to 2 minutes on first side, 1 on opposite. Turn off heat, add brandy and let it absorb, turning meat in it. Remove meat to a plate. Let cool completely, 10 to 15 minutes, then add about 1 teaspoon mustard to each steak and spread to coat only the top side.
Preheat oven to 400˚F, with rack at center.  
Roll out dough a bit on floured surface and cut into 4 portions. Lightly roll out each puff pastry rectangle 3 to 4 times with a rolling pin until each rectangle is an even thickness (about 1/8 inch thick). Leave a border on each piece of dough and spread each piece with a centered layer of about 2 ounces mousse pate (do not press, just gently spread). Top with about one-fourth of cooled duxelles and center a steak, mustard-side down, on the mushrooms. Wrap and trim the pastry, then use egg wash to seal; flip and brush with more egg wash. Scraps can be used to make decorations to apply to crust if you have the patience for it.     
Arrange Wellingtons on parchment-lined baking sheet and bake until golden.

"This is just a really fun and easy brunch, lunch or dinner," says Rach of her shakshuka with diced winter vegetables. "And it's crazy good!" 
Pro Tip from Rach: You can buy za'atar, but it's really easy to make your own. My blend makes one cup and keeps a few months in a tight container in a cool place. Use it in my Chicken Schwarma and Tahini Caesar Salad, as well as on popcorn, in marinades and sprinkled into pilafs and onto Greek yogurt drizzled with olive oil. 
Ingredients
3 large red peppers
3 tablespoons olive oil
4 cups diced winter vegetables, such as carrots and/or butternut squash and turnips or kohlrabi (cabbage turnip/German turnip)
Salt and pepper
1 large onion, chopped
1 bulb peeled garlic, 7 or 8 cloves, sliced or chopped
3 tablespoons za'atar, homemade (¼ cup sumac, ¼ cup toasted sesame seeds, 2 tablespoons dried oregano, 2 tablespoons dried thyme, 2 tablespoons ground cumin, 1 tablespoon ground coriander and 1 tablespoon Urfa chili; see Tip) or store-bought
2 tablespoons pimenton/smoked sweet paprika
2 tablespoons harissa or 1 tablespoon Calabrian chili paste (optional), for extra spicy
One 28-ounce can Italian diced tomatoes or plum tomatoes and juices, hand crushed
2 cups passata or crushed tomatoes
A splash of white wine vinegar or lemon juice
8 to 10 eggs
Chopped parsley and dill, about ½ cup  
Charred sourdough or rustic white bread
1 halved garlic clove, for rubbing bread
EVOO, for drizzling
Flaky sea salt
Yield

Ingredients
4 organic boneless, skinless chicken breasts (about 8 oz. each)

Salt and pepper

1 tsp. (about 1/3 palmful) fennel seeds

3 tbsp. olive oil

1 red field pepper or red bell pepper, finely chopped

1 onion, finely chopped

4 large cloves garlic, chopped or grated

6 to 8 Italian hot pickled pepper rings in brine, not oil (I like Cento), drained and chopped

1 rounded tsp. (about 1/3 palmful) dried oregano or marjoram

3 tbsp. sun-dried tomato paste

3 to 4 ounces (about a 3- to 4-inch piece) good-quality pepperoni, casing removed and meat coarsely grated or thinly sliced

¾ cup red vermouth or red wine

1 ½ to 2 cups tomato passata or tomato sauce

¼ cup (a small handful) fresh flat-leaf parsley tops, chopped

1 ball (8 oz.) fresh mozzarella, sliced

A handful of fresh basil leaves, torn

Italian bread with sesame seeds, for dipping

Preparation
Step 1

Using a knife, remove the tenders (the small pieces of meat that are attached to the breast) from the chicken breasts. Cut the tenders crosswise in half. Arrange the breasts between sheets of parchment. Using the flat side of a meat mallet, pound the meat to about 1/2 inch thick. Cut each breast crosswise into 3 pieces. Season the chicken with salt, pepper, and fennel seeds.

Step 2

Preheat the broiler.

Step 3

In a large cast-iron skillet, heat about 2 tbsp. oil, two turns of the pan, over medium-high. Add the chicken and cook until lightly browned, about 3 minutes. Turn the chicken over and cook until cooked through, 2 to 5 minutes more. Transfer the chicken to a platter.

Step 4

Reduce heat to medium and add the remaining 1 tbsp. oil, one turn of the pan, to the skillet. Add the field pepper and onion and cook, stirring often, until the vegetables soften slightly, about 2 minutes. Add the garlic, pickled peppers, and oregano. Cook, stirring constantly, until aromatic, about 1 minute. Add the tomato paste and stir for a minute; stir in the pepperoni. Add the vermouth. Cook, stirring constantly, until the sauce is thick, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in the passata and parsley, then slide the chicken back into the skillet. Cook, stirring often, until the sauce thickens slightly, 1 to 2 minutes more.

Step 5

Top the chicken with the mozzarella. Broil until browned in spots, about 3 minutes. Top with the basil. Serve from the pan with crusty bread for dipping.

While pasta cooks, place broccolini in 1-inch of water in a sauce pot and bring up to a boil. Add salt to the water and add the trimmed broccolini. Cover and cook 5 minutes, drain and reserve. To hot, cooked pasta add a drizzle of EVOO, butter, ricotta, lemon zest, thyme, broccolini and season with salt and pepper. Toss pasta to coat it in the cheese and butter. Season it with salt, to your taste. Portion pasta onto dinner plates alongside meat roll slices and top pasta with tomatoes and freshly ground pepper.
Curry MeatloafIngredients
7 eggs, divided

1/4 cup curry powder or create your own blend with turmeric, cumin and coriander in equal parts and a little ground mustard, cinnamon and paprika for balance

2 tablespoons olive oil

1 small onion, chopped

1 carrot, grated or minced

1 fresh chili pepper, seeded and finely chopped

1 1-inch piece of ginger, grated

3-4 cloves garlic, finely chopped

1/4 cup dry sherry

2 pounds ground turkey breast, turkey or chicken

3 slices good-quality white bread, cubed

Milk, to soak bread

Salt and pepper

1/2 cup organic or low-sugar ketchup

1/4 cup Sriracha sauce

A handful of cilantro or parsley, chopped

4 scallions, whites and greens, finely chopped

Mango chutney, to pass at the table, such as Patak’s brand

Buttered, grilled garlic naan bread

Preparation
Place 5 eggs in cold water, cover with water, bring to a boil, then cover the pan and let stand for 8 minutes (2 minutes shy of hard-boiled eggs). Drain the eggs. Crack the shells and soak in cold water to loosen. Peel the eggs.

Heat the skillet with spices to toast, then add the oil and stir to heat; add the onions, carrots, chili, ginger and garlic. Stir to soften for a few minutes, then deglaze the pan with sherry and cool.

Pre-heat the oven to 375°F.

Place the meat in a bowl. Squeeze the excess milk from the bread and crumble into crumbs as you add to the meat. Season the meat with salt and pepper. Combine the ketchup and sriracha. Add half the mixture to the meat. Add the cooled curry spice, vegetables, cilantro or parsley, and scallions to meat. Beat the remaining 2 eggs and add to the meat mixture. Combine the meatloaf mix.

Line a large baking sheet with parchment and place the loaf mix down in large free-form rectangle shape. Set the cooked eggs end-to-end through the meat, then build the loaf up and around the eggs. The finished loaf should be 3-4 inches high and 10-12 inches long with the eggs evenly nested so that once cut, the hard boiled egg sliced will be at center of your loaf. Brush the loaf with remaining ketchup and Sriracha sauce and bake for 60-75 minutes, until cooked through. Let the meatloaf stand for 10 minutes, then slice and serve with a dollop of mango chutney and naan bread alongside.
