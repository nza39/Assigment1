Hi,
I received the email.

Hi Mr. Maldonado,

I transferred to SFU in the summer and I applied to amend my study permit two weeks ago. At the moment I am just waiting for my permit to be mailed back to me. The only thing that is being amended is the conditions of the study permit because I was not allowed to work off-campus before I transferred.

I attach my old study permit which is valid till 2025, as well as my SIN number and my enrolment letter.

I will send you my new permit with the conditions amended as soon as I get it back. I expect it to be mailed around mid-February.

I do know this is an inconvenience, so if you need anything else please let me know.

For real, thank you so much for your help.

Best regards,

Hi Mr. Mulholland,

Hope this email finds you well.

My name is Natalia Zuluaga (student number: 301540979), I’m in MATH152 with Dr. Michael Monaghan.

I’m writing to you because yesterday I was not able to submit my assignment (Assignment #4) due to a problem with my Crowdmark account (I attached a screenshot of the Crowdmark error).

Unfortunately, I just got it fixed this morning, but I submitted my assignment right away. I was wondering if it is still possible to get my assignment graded, even if it is with a sort of penalty. Please, take in to account that I always tend to submit my assignments on time (as shown in the Crowdmark platform).

Sorry for the inconvenience and thank you for your help.

I look forward to hearing from you,

Dear FIC Finance Team,

Currently, I have an outstanding balance in my FIC account of $1,749 and to reach the minimum balance I must pay $8,398 before March 18.

Nevertheless, my family is not currently in good financial standing, and it would be extremely helpful if we could make some sort of arrangement. 

Next semester, I'll be taking just 3 courses worth $3,157.90 (STAT203, POL141, ECON260) and I'll be taking the GuardMe Plus insurance.  This is for a total of $8,404.20 + the outstanding balance. 

If it's fine with you, I can make the payment shortly after March 20, or I can make small payments instead.

I urge you to please consider my petition

Thanks in advance,

Hi Dr. Gary,

I have a couple of questions regarding the relative rate problems. 

In question 12 I used the Pythagoras theorem and I differentiated the formula. I found how fast is the professor falling when the height is 3ft, but I wasn't able to find at what speed does he hits the ground because the height is equal to 0 dh/dt cancels.

In question 15 I used the differentiation of the supply equation that was given and then I replaced the values of x, p and dp/dt. However, I know my answer is wrong because the rate at which the supply is changing is positive and it should be negative as the price is falling. I just don't know what I'm doing wrong hahaha ;(

I attach the pictures of the problems.

Thanks in advance!

---

Thanks!

Hi Dr. Gary,

I was not able to join at 2pm today and I tried at 2:30pm and the meeting was already over.

I had a question about the point 11.b. Of the assignment. 

I have been trying to find the derivative of f(x) =(x-5)^4/x^2, but I just have not been able to do it without using the product or quotient rules.

I tried to do it by using the definition of derivative and it still has some exponents that I can't factorize. 

Please let me know what you think I should do. 

Thanks in advance for your help,

Hi Micaela,

I am Natalia Zuluaga (FIC ID: ZULND2103). Before the end of the term I talked to an student advisor and she helped me to chose my courses for the next term. However, the courses that currently appear in my timetable do not match the courses that I chose during the advising meeting.

The main problem with the current courses is that I already took ECON103. I am supposed to take ECON105 this term. 

The courses I originally chose with the advisors were:

MATH 157 - Class #1
PHIL 105 - Class #2
PSYC 109 - Class #2
ECON 105 - Class #3

I appreciate if you can help me to enroll in this courses instead of the ones I currently have. 

Thanks in advance, 

Natalia Zuluaga 
FIC ID : ZULND2103

Hi Micaela,

Thanks for the help!

I just checked and the ECON105 course looks good now.

If possible, I would prefer to take MATH157 (class#1) on Thursday from 2:00pm to 6:00pm and PSYC109 (class#2) on Monday from 2:00pm to 6:00pm.

Hi Jess,

I hope this email finds you well.

Thanks for your feedback on my reflection.

To answer your questions:

1. During the last years, I have developed some strategies to balance different responsibilities. These have come as a result of similar experiences that taught me how much I can handle without compromising my health. Nowadays, to do so,  I always try to manage my time correctly by creating an agenda for the day and by establishing specific goals I must accomplish within a certain period of time. Additionally, when I feel like I need it, I ask for someone's advice to see from another perspective whether I'm making the right decisions or not. Furthermore, I try to get a lot of sleep, eat well, spend time with friends and enjoy work, volunteering, or school.

2. Now, based on that experience, whenever I feel like I need some motivation, I think about how things never come easy and how if you want something you need to work for it at first to see the results afterwards. I have learned that when you feel proud and satisfied because of something you accomplished it's because you truly worked hard to do so. Accordingly, although sometimes it's not easy, I always try to think about the amazing feeling of finally achieving what you wanted. 

As a peer educator, I believe that I will be able to motivate students by reminding them that is completely worth it to make an effort to accomplish things academically, not just to fulfill a requirement or get a certain grade, but to feel good with themselves, grow, learn and truly take advantage of this massive opportunity we have been given.   


Again, thank you very much for this second chance.

I look forward to hearing from you,

Natalia Zuluaga

Secondary consumers: chickadee, lizard, spider, field mouse, rattle snake.

Primary consumer: dragonfly, ladybug, morpho butterfly, deer, beetle, grasshopper, squirrel, mosquito, eyeglassed bear.

Producers: grasses, berries and flowers.

Decomposers: mushroom.


2. The extinction of a single specie of insects in an ecosystem like this wouldn't cause a collapse because the other animals that feed with this insect (spider, lizard) also feeds with other insect species therefore they would not go hungry. Also the plants (producers) that the insect ate won't increase it's population because there are other primary consumers that feed with this plants.

Hello Taili. 
Hope everything is fine. I’m sending the signed contract. Thanks for asking, we are still okay for moving in. But we were wondering if we could go one more time to check the space so we could arrange how to organize it (furniture and decoration), but if it is too complicated is fine and we’ll wait. 
Have a nice day 
Ana

Hello Taili!

 

I hope you had an amazing wekeend. I am sending the application format.

Yet, because the rent would be paid by our parents, let me know if I should send their bank statements, or if you wish the recipts of what we have paid to SFU in the last year ($30,000 dollars each of us).

 

There is no problem with the deposit, we could pay the first rent along with the deposit right away if requiered.  

 

Thank you in advance, and please do not hesitate to contact me for any doubt.

Hello Taili, 
Sure thing, I am attaching a Word Document with the receipts of the payments from last year (over $90,000 in total), and bank statements from each of our parents as well as my personal Bank statement (Ana).
- Our full names are: Jeronimo Silva, Juliana Herrera, Ana Sofia Mayorca. 
- Mails (in same order): jeronimo.silva.moreno@gmail.com , juls.h26@gmail.com , anamayorcaalzate@gmail.com 
- Phone Numbers (): 236 8672883, 778 6390639 , 604 6554256 
- The job is Jeronimo's I'm sorry about the typo, it is in fact $1,300

We are okay with the place being unfurnished, it will give us an opportunity to get our own things. Just a question, are any utilities included?

Thank you in advance,
Ana Mayorca

Hello Taili! 
Those are great news! Thank you so much, we are looking forward for this relationship. 

Sure thing we will arrange the deposit. Is it okay for you to do it via e-transfer? 
I’ll talk to them so we can arrange a time to sign the tenancy agreement. 
Yet, we don’t have any furniture at the moment so I don’t think we would need the move in caretaker. 
We don’t have a car, but we would like to have the stall for when our friends/parents come over. 
Thank you and have a great day!

Sure! 
I’ll be living with two other people, Juliana (21) and Jerónimo (19) who abre studying film and myself, an Economics major. We are all SFU students about to start out second year. So far we’ve been living in SFU Residence, but we are looking for something of our own where we don’t have to share a bathroom with 30 strangers. 
Our parents will be paying for rent as we are full time students, and we sometimes work but for poker money. 
The location is perfect for us because we love being bear campus and not commuting for class. We would be more than happy to sign a one year lease. 
Thank you. 
Ana Mayorca

Hello! 
That would be perfect, anything in that span of time would work for us. But if you can do 2 that would be perfect. X2
A bit about ourselves:

Ana Mayorca. 
I am 18 years old and about to start my second year as an Economics major with minor in data analytics. In my free time I enjoy reading and going out with friends to enjoy the city and surroundings. My parents are my income source throughout my whole career 

Juliana Herrera
I’m 21 and I’m a second year film student. Currently my parents are paying for my tuition and housing fees. Right now I’m very focused on my studies since I want to get an scholarship for the contemporary arts program as well as a sports scholarship. 

Jeronimo Silva
I am a Colombian student here in SFU. Im studying Film and its something that I’ve liked since I started high school, I also have a very big passion for music, I’m a singer and a songwriter. I arrived here to Canada in January and I aspire to make the most of my stay here in BC. I don’t smoke nor I would like to, I have a history of smokers in my household and that’s something I don’t want for myself. Im a very calm person most of the time I’m playing in my computer or watching movies.

---

Hello Joanne, 
That would be great, please let me know what your aunt thinks. The idea would be for me and Juliana to share a room, as we’ve known each other for a long time and basically stay together all the time. 
Perfect! I’ll see you there. 
Have a nice day 
Ana

Dear enrollment team,

My name is Ana Mayorca, and my ID is MAYAD2103.
As I plan to study economics with a minor in data analysis, its on my best interest to take ECON260 and CMPT120 during my last semester at fic. But the former is only offered on Monday 11-1 which conflicts with the only available time slot for Econ. Thus, I wanted to take ECON260 asynchronous, but it is filled. Would it be possible to be enrolled in the Asynchronous section for ECON260? As all of the other courses are not as useful for my degree.
For the meantime I enrolled in PSYC102 so that I would lose my spot for CMPT120 and HIST102. But I would love if you could change PSYC120 for ECON260 async.

Best regards,
Ana Mayorca.

Good morning,, 
My name is Ana Mayorca, I'm currently studying at SFU and I'm interested in working with you, I have experience with customer service, I am a quick learner and an enthusiast which I believe makes me a great addition to your team. Currently, I am leaving in residence so it is convenient and in case of an emergency, I can get fast to the shop.

My class schedule is as follows and I am free every time besides it.

Hello Micaela. 
My name is Ana Mayorca, and my ID is MAYAD2103. 
I was trying to enroll for my last semester at FIC, but all of the courses I am interested in/ need to take are full. I want to major in Economics and minor in Data analysis, thus I would need to take CMPT120 and ECON260. But they are already full, I couldn’t do my enrollment early due to problems back home and finals stress and non of the other classes are useful for my degree. Is there any chance you could help me? 
Best regards, 
Ana Mayorca.
